This portable logger was initially developed for a care agency to log the attendance of the care workers at service userâ€™s house.
The portable logger could also be used to track time on bicycle races where it could track positions at different stops where RFID tags could be placed at these locations.
The date is in a CSV file format which could be opened with any Office software.
